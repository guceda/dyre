    title: "Supercooling liquid water",
    content:
      "Supercooling liquid water to record low temperatures has revealed new evidence that it can exist as two different liquids simultaneously. Supercooled water – liquid water chilled below its freezing point without being allowed to freeze – has been baffling chemists for decades. Previous studies found that the extent to which water molecules pack together, known as their density, starts to fluctuate as water is cooled to extremely low temperatures. Since then, evidence has been mounting that these fluctuations may indicate the presence of two different liquids in one, with some water molecules packed more closely together and others spaced further apart. But researchers have struggled to study these two different liquids, because supercooled water usually freezes nanoseconds after it is formed. By firing lasers at an extremely thin sheet of ice, Greg Kimmel and Bruce Kay at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington were able to briefly generate and analyse supercooled liquid water at much lower temperatures than had been possible previously. During the fraction of a second in which the water was in its supercooled state, the team took a snapshot of its structure using infrared spectroscopy, a method that takes advantage of the way infrared light is transmitted through molecules.",

    title: "Why do we sleep?",
    content:
      "Why do we sleep? The answer may depend on your age, according to research that suggests the main role of sleep shifts at the age of around two-and-a-half. Newborn babies sleep a lot, and this gradually reduces as they get older. To find out why sleep alters as the brain develops, Van Savage at the University of California, Los Angeles, and his colleagues collected published data on brain activity and size and sleep duration across different age groups. They used this information to build a model of how these aspects might be expected to change as we grow. This allowed them to swap in different figures to test various ideas. For example, if the brain is learning during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, this would lead to a prediction that the duration of REM sleep is linked to aspects of brain development, which can then be tested against published findings. The group found that most of the brain processes associated with learning occur during REM sleep, and that this appears to be the most important function of sleep generally in young infants, who get much more REM sleep than adults. But there seems to be an abrupt shift in toddlers. “Before two-and-a-half, sleep is mainly about... rewiring the brain to learn and grow,” says Savage. But after this age, the main function of sleep appears to be the repair of any damage to the brain. “I was surprised that it was such a sharp transition point,” says Savage, who likens the sudden change to water freezing into ice.",

    title: "Walking with shoes",
    content:
      "Shoes that push up the toes make walking easier, a small study shows. The downside is that this may weaken the foot, increasing the risk of a common and painful condition called plantar fasciitis. When Freddy Sichting at the Chemnitz University of Technology in Germany went running with Daniel Lieberman of Harvard University – whose work helped popularise barefoot running – the pair discussed the way that the soles of most shoes curve upwards under the toes, a feature called a toe spring. “It is such an obvious feature of nearly every shoe,” says Sichting. Despite this, no one had studied its effect on the foot before, he says. So Sichting, Lieberman and their colleagues got 13 volunteers aged between 19 and 33 to walk on a treadmill while barefoot or wearing sandals with a toe spring angle of 10, 20, 30 or 40 degrees. Using sandals rather than shoes allowed them to record the foot’s 3D motion. From this, they could work out how active the muscles of the foot were during walking. The results show that footwear with a toe spring means the muscles have to do a little less work per step to stabilise the foot, says Sichting, with higher toe spring angles boosting the effect . This could weaken the muscles and place stress on other tissues such as the plantar fascia, a layer of connective tissue running under the foot. Putting the foot under a lot more stress than normal raises the risk of damaging this tissue and developing plantar fasciitis, says Sichting.",

    title: "AI and cameras",
    content:
      "An AI linked to a camera can tell the physical properties of surfaces without touching them. Matthew Purri and Kristin Dana at Rutgers University in New Jersey have trained an algorithm that can determine the tactile traits of an object when presented solely with a photograph or series of images of it. They took photographs of more than 400 materials, including cloth, plastic, leather and wood surfaces. The pair took 100 images of each surface using a device with an arm that can be moved to take photos at exact camera angles. These images were linked to an existing data set about the materials. For each material, 15 physical properties were logged in categories including friction, adhesion and texture. Using all this, they trained a deep-learning algorithm and tested it on surfaces it hadn’t seen before. Given a single image taken from directly above an object, the algorithm could reliably estimate 14 of its 15 surface properties. The researchers believe the algorithm could be used in robots and in cars to improve road safety by estimating the surface properties of roads.",
