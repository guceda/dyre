    content: "We raced to the Monet house, Michael certain that they would turn us away, me practicing what I would tell the guard in our defense. As soon as he started to scold us, I said: ‘‘The tomato! It was the tomato’s fault. It was trop bonne,’’ using the French expression for ‘‘too good’’ to convey the understanding that the tomato was both delicious and impossible to resist. The guard smiled with amusement and also, it seemed, recognition — he’d had things that were trop bonne, too.",

    content: "I rarely met a French person who wouldn’t stop everything to talk about food, and the guard was no exception. He asked if the tomato had been cooked; was it served hot or cold; was it seasoned in a special way? I described the dish, and when I told him what else we’d had, he called me gourmande, the word for greedy, and pointed the way to the entrance.",

    content: "I’ve returned to the gardens twice since then, but I’ve made my version of that tomato dish countless times, and each time I’m startled by how beautiful it is. Everything you do to make the dish, which isn’t much, seems to brighten what is basic and beloved about a tomato: its form, flavor, texture and hue.",

    content: "The dish is simply a tomato, peeled and roasted at a very low temperature for a few hours in a pan with an ample amount of olive oil, enough to baste the tomato regularly. Even before it’s ready, it’s lovely: Each new application of oil is like a fresh coat of glossy polish. When it’s cooked through to tender, it holds its shape, its color too, but it seems almost translucent — you see a tracery of ribs and veins along its contours. But you can’t know the true brilliance of the dish until you taste it: The tomato is vegetal and rich, as you would expect, but it’s also a bit sweet and a touch citrusy. The surprise is at the core. At the start, you peel the tomato, then cut a small, conical wedge out of the top, a hollow to fill with sugar and lime zest. During the hours in the oven, basting with that blend of oil and sugar and zest, the ingredients find their way into every fiber of the tomato, technically making it a kind of confit, a dish cooked in fat (like duck confit) or sugar (like candied cherries).",
